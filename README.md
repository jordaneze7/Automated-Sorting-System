🦾 Arduino Control Project – Automated Sorting System

🎯 Objective Program an Arduino to control an operative system that simulates an industrial sorting mechanism. The system features two modes: 

-Manual mode: Allows direct control of the arm, gripper, and loader using physical buttons and switches on the control panel. 

-Automatic mode: Automatically sorts washers based on their color: 

-Red → chute #1 (left) 

-Metallic → chute #2 (center) 

-Black → chute #3 (right) The system returns to its initial state before and after each sorting sequence. 

⚙️ Key Features 

-Full control of a robotic arm with movement functions (left, right, up, down) 

-Gripper open/close logic 

-Loader activation/deactivation 

-Light indicators: 

-Green LED: Manual mode 

-Red LED: Automatic mode 

-Blinking light: Error state 

-Well-structured code with #define constants, functions for each movement, and clearly commented logic 

-Excel file mapping all inputs and outputs (22 inputs, 10 outputs) 

🧠 Project Steps (as recommended) 

1.Create pseudocode and plan 

2.Identify all I/Os 

3.Define constants and pin mapping 

4.Write and test movement functions 

5.Implement automatic mode 

6.Implement manual mode 

7.Final testing and evaluation
